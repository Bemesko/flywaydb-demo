# Flyway Demo

Getting Started: https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/quickstart-how-flyway-works-184127223.html

This repository has some codes sketches I did while learning more about Flyway

## My Testing Scenario

## Evaluation Criteria
Since I'm evaluating Flyway against other similar tools I have come up with a couple of features to take into consideration. Hopefully I'll have a good idea about each of them after following this project through to the end.

### POC Complexity
*how difficult is it to build a working demo*

### Cost
*What I can and cannot do with the free plans*

### SQL Server Compatibility

### Impact on Developer Workflow
*How transparent will the transition be, from not knowing a new tool is being used in the pipeline to having to learn a brand new tool*

### Integration with Existing Databases
*How well can I take an existing, populated database and start using Liquibase?*

### Documentation
*How well is the project documented*

### Support
*Taking into consideration if the tool is still currently maintained and supported, and how much longer this support will last*

### Rollback
*How easy is it to rollback changes once they are commited*

### Reuse of Existing SQL Scripts
*How well can I reuse my existing SQL scripts repository*

### Maintenance of Integration
*How much has to be set up in order for CI/CD to work and how fragile is it*
